## Usage
To use this package you can just pull the latest image version from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dorfjungs/wordpress-breeze). This package covers things like initially installing plugins, creating an admin user with a defined password, creating the database from scratch, injecting the config from the user, dynamically handling wordpress templates (a.k.a pages in this context).

### Integrate inside docker-compose
To use the package inside your a `docker-compose.yml` you can either reference the image directly or create a new `Dockerfile` if you want to do some customization to the base distribution. A basic setup for docker-compose could look like this:

```yml
app:
  image: dorfjungs/wordpress-breeze:v1.0
  volumes:
    src:/var/mnt/src
    vendor:/var/mnt/vendor
    assets:/var/mnt/assets
    uploads:/var/mnt/uploads
    composer:/var/mnt/composer
  environment:
    WORDPRESS_HOST: yourpage.localhost
    WORDPRESS_TITLE: yourPage
    DATABASE_HOST: database
    DATABASE_NAME: someDbName
    DATABASE_USER: someDbUser
    DATABASE_PASS: aComplexDatabasePassword
```

### Available volumes
| Mount point | Required | Description|
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| /var/mnt/vendor | no | Here will the vendor files from composer be placed. So the integrator will have code completion etc. Use this if you're still using code completion for php.
| /var/mnt/composer | yes | The basedir where your `composer.json` is located. This is used to merge de depencencies between the container and your installation. **So make sure a composer.json exists** (and is valid).
| /var/mnt/src | yes | All the source files mapped to the namespace `\Breeze\...`
| /var/mnt/assets | yes | Images, fonts, scripts, styles etc.
| /var/mnt/templates | yes | All twig templates for views, partials etc.
| /var/mnt/uploads | yes | The uploads folder to keep data persistent
| /var/mnt/templates | yes | The twig templates used for the views

### Available environment variables
| Name | Required  | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| APPLICATION_ENV | no | This will do some optimization regarding the current environment Possible options are `dev` and `prod`. Default: `prod`
| DATABASE_HOST | yes | The database host within your services or stack. If the port differs from `3306` you can extend it like: `localhost:1337`
| DATABASE_NAME | yes | The database name of the instance
| DATABASE_USER | yes | The user for the database
| DATABASE_PASS | yes | Database password for the user
| WORDPRESS_HOST | yes | The host (domain) used for the instance
| WORDPRESS_TITLE | yes | The title of your wordpress site
| ADMIN_PASSWORD | yes | The password used for the initial admin user
| PERMALINK_STRUCTURE | no | The permalink structure to use. Default: /blog/%postname%/
| ACF_PRO_KEY | no | The ACF pro key used for the installation
| WP_ROCKET_EMAIL | no | The mail address for wp-rocket pro
| WP_ROCKET_KEY | no | The wp rocket pro key
> Database should be MySQL

### Configuration
To configure your application to your needs accordingly, you have one entrypoint for all the configurations available to the container, which is located inside the mounted volume under `src/config.php`. The default configuration looks like this:

```php
/**
 * Which package should be used to extend the current modules,
 * layouts and groups from
 */
'acf_breeze_extends' => 'acfbreeze',

/**
 * The ACF modules to use. These will be injected into the
 * base application provided by wp-breeze
 */
'acf_breeze_modules' => [],

/**
 * The ACF groups to use. These will be injected into the
 * base application provided by wp-breeze
 */
'acf_breeze_groups' => [],

/**
 * The ACF layouts to use. These will be injected into the
 * base application provided by wp-breeze
 */
'acf_breeze_layouts' => [],

/**
 * ACF option pages to register through wp-breeze.
 * This will simply be directed to `acf_add_options_page`
 * after some checks
 */
'acf_breeze_option_pages' => [],

/**
 * The wordpress actions (hooks) to register before
 * the application "bootstraps"
 */
'wp_breeze_actions' => [],

/**
 * Simple view helpers for the twig template engine.
 * These will be injected by the twig adaptor from wp-breeze
 */
'wp_breeze_view_helpers' => [],

/**
 * Additional template paths for the wp breeze engine.
 * These will be used as base path for the twig engine.
 * So you can just include twig files inside theses paths.
 * Default: [ templates ]
 */
'wp_breeze_template_paths' => [],

/**
 * The pages to sync with the wordpress instance.
 * This is basically page -> controller -> view (twig)
 */
'wp_pages' => []
```

### The ACF-Breeze field hierarchy
The module `acf-breeze` basically creates a pattern with `acfbuilder`. So there is a definition for the inputs in the backend. The main field types (groups, layouts, modules) basically builds upon this structure:

```
+--------+
| Group  |
+---+----+
    |
+---v----+
| Layout |
+---+----+
    |
+---v----+
| Module |
+--------+
```
> Each type can be used independently off each other

#### Using groups
Groups are the most basic form of fields. They can be used on pages through conditions or custom option pages. For instance, to create a basic navigation theme selection for a selection of pages it would look like this:

```php
namespace Breeze\Fields\Groups;

use AcfBreeze\Builder\Group;
use AcfBreeze\FieldsBuilder;

class NavigationThemeGroup extends Group {
  /**
   * @var string
   */
  protected $title = 'Navigation Theme';

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  protected $params = [
    'locations' => [
      ['post_type', '==', 'post', 'or'],
      ['post_type', '==', 'page', 'and'],
      ['page_template', '==', 'default'],
    ],
  ];

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public function builder(FieldsBuilder &$builder) {
    parent::builder($builder);

    $builder
      ->addSelect('navigation_theme', [ 'label' => 'Theme' ])
      ->addChoices([ ['dark' => 'Dark'], ['bright' => 'Bright'] ]);
  }
}
```

#### Using layouts
Layouts are used to give the modules a wrapper. As an example you can create multiple layouts inside a group to create separation in form of sections. And inside these layouts you can place the modules in a defined behavior (e.g. with columns). As simple layout putting a repeater fields for the module inside itself would look like this:

```php
namespace Breeze\Fields\Layouts;

use AcfBreeze\FieldsBuilder;
use AcfBreeze\Builder\Field;
use AcfBreeze\Builder\Layout;
use StoutLogic\AcfBuilder\FlexibleContentBuilder;
use StoutLogic\AcfBuilder\FieldsBuilder as StoutLogicFieldsBuilder;

class SimpleLayout extends Layout {
  /**
   * @var string
   */
  protected $title = 'Simple Layout';

  /**
   * @var FlexibleContentBuilder
   */
  private $flexContent = null;

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  protected function builder(FieldsBuilder &$builder) {
      parent::builder($builder);

      // Attach received module as select options under modules_content filed
      $this->flexContent = $field->addTab('Content')->addFlexibleContent(
        'modules_content',
        [ 'label' => __('Modules') ]
      );
  }

  /**
   * @param Field $builder
   * @return void
   */
  public function addModule(Field &$builder) {
    // Receive modules and put them inside the content tab
    $this->flexContent->addLayout($builder->getBuilder());
  }
}
```

#### Using modules
Modules are used inside layouts and layouts **only**. A simple spacer module could look like this:

```php

namespace AcfBreeze\Package\Modules;

use AcfBreeze\Builder\Field;
use AcfBreeze\FieldsBuilder;

class SpacerModule extends Field {
  /**
   * @var string
   */
  protected $title = 'Spacer Module';

  /**
   * @var array
   */
  protected $params = [
    'choices' => [
      ['small' => 'Small'],
      ['medium' => 'Medium'],
      ['large' => 'Large']
    ]
  ];

  /**
   * @param AcfBreeze\FieldsBuilder $builder
   * @return void
   */
  protected function builder(FieldsBuilder &$builder) {
    parent::builder($builder);

    $builder->addSelect('type', ['wrapper' => ['width' => 50]])
            ->addChoices($this->getParam('choices'));
  }
}
```

#### Adding the fields to the config
To add the fileds to the config you can simply assign a name and refer to the fields class (either group, layout or module). Lets say you want to add a group to your fields. That would look like this:

```php
'acf_breeze_groups' => [
  'content' => \Breeze\Groups\ContentGroup::class
]
```

To tell the group to include some layouts you would add a extended configuration array:

```php
'acf_breeze_groups' => [
  'class' => \Breeze\Fields\Groups\ContentGroup::class,

  // The prefix to add before the modules repeater
  'entry' => 'flex_content',

  // This will include all layouts added to this package
  'layouts' => '*'

  // This would include only the "simple layout"
  // 'layouts' => [ 'simple' ]
]
```

Layouts and modules are added in the same manner:
```php
'acf_breeze_layouts' => [
  'simple' => [
    'class' => \Breeze\Fields\Layouts\SimpleLayout::class,
    'modules' => '*'
  ]
]

'acf_breeze_modules' => [
  'spacer' => [
    'class' => \Breeze\Fields\Modules\SpacerModule::class,

    // Override params to fit the needs
    'params' => [
      'choices' => [
        ['sm' => 'SM'],
        ['md' => 'MD']
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

// Or short syntax
'acf_breeze_modules' => [
  'spacer' => \Breeze\Fields\Modules\SpacerModule::class
]
```

You can disable groups, layouts and modules from an inherent package like this:
```php
'acf_breeze_layouts' => [
  'simple' => false
]
```

#### The acfbuilder
The whole structure is build with the package [`StoutLogic/acf-builder`](https://github.com/StoutLogic/acf-builder). So everytime you get the `$builder` variable you can check on the acfbuilder documentation to see what functions are available.


### View controllers with templates (a.k.a pages)
To simplify the whole process from a custom template to the rendered view via `twig`, you can now add a simple mapping to the config with the name of the page to the view controller.
For instance a simple controller for the index page would look like this:

```php
namespace Breeze\Controllers;

use WpBreeze\Controllers\AbstractController;

class IndexController extends AbstractController {
  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public function render() {
    return $this->timber->render('views/index.twig', [
      'customVariable1' => 'test1',
      'customVariable2' => 'test2',
    ]);
  }
}
```

To register the controller with a corresponding page you would register it like this:
```php
'wp_pages' => [
  'index' => [ 'Startpage', '\Breeze\Controllers\IndexController::class' ]
]
```
> Make sure to pass the controller class as a string, since this will be used for code generation


#### Overriding the default template
You can't. Since this template can be useful for testing countainers state it will remain static. This forces the editor to select a custom template in the backend

### View helpers
View helpers are used within a twig template and registered via the config. For instance, lets create an ajax link generator with a view helper

```php
namespace Breeze\ViewHelpers;

class AjaxUrlViewHelper extends AbstractViewHelper {
  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public $name = 'ajax_url';

  /**
   * @param string $action
   * @return string
   */
  public function render($action, $args = []) {
    $argsStr = '';

    foreach ($args as $name => $value) {
      $argsStr .= $name . '=' . $value;
    }

    return (
      rtrim(admin_url(), '/')
        . '/admin-ajax.php?action='
        . $action
        . (!empty($argsStr) ? '&' : '')
        . $argsStr;
  }
}

```

#### Registering the view helper
To register a view helper simply tell the config:

```php
'wp_breeze_view_helpers' => [
  \Breeze\ViewHelpers\AjaxUrlViewHelper::class
]
```

#### Using the view helper
After you've registered the view helper you can use the view helper by simply calling a function named after the view helper:

```html
<a href="{{ajax_url('action_name', { 'param1': 'test' })}}">
```

### Actions (wp actions and filters combined)
Actions are just a combination and abstraction of wordpress action and filter "system". For instance, if you want to add hook into the `body_class` filter you can do it like this:

```php
namespace Breeze\Actions;

use WpBreeze\Actions\AbstractAction;

class BodyClassAction extends AbstractAction {
  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public $name = 'body-class-action';

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public $hookType = self::HOOK_FILTER; // Default = self::HOOK_ACTION

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public $hook = 'body_class';

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public function run($params = []) {
    return array_merge($params['args'][0], [
      'custom-class-1',
      'custom-class-2'
    ]);
  }
}
```
> Now you can share this action across multiple instances or put it into a base library


#### Adding priority and parameter quantification to the action
Since we're bound to some wordpress patterns you can define a priority and the parameter count like this (both optional and not mutually exclusive):

```php
public $hook = 'body_class(10, 3)';
```


#### Registering the action
Actions are simple to register:

```php
'wp_breeze_actions' => [
  \Breeze\Actions\BodyClassAction::class
]
```
